# Phase 3: V1.0 (Automation & Persistence)

## Scope
This phase transitions the application from a manual MVP to a fully automated, polished, and robust product. The focus is on background operation, data persistence, and a seamless user experience, culminating in a deployable application.

## Deliverables
*   The AI analysis workflow is triggered automatically in the background at regular intervals.
*   All suggestions and user interactions (`accepted`/`rejected`) are stored in a Supabase database.
*   The menu bar icon is dynamic, providing users with real-time feedback on the application's status (e.g., idle, analyzing, error).
*   A robust onboarding flow that checks for required Accessibility permissions and guides the user to grant them if they are missing.
*   A complete build and deployment pipeline configured for code-signed and notarized macOS releases.

## Features & Tasks

### 1. Integrate Supabase for Persistence
1.  Install the `@supabase/supabase-js` dependency.
2.  Create `src/main/services/supabase-service.ts` to encapsulate all database queries.
3.  Initialize the Supabase client using environment variables for the URL and public key.
4.  Modify the suggestion workflow to log the outcome of every suggestion (accepted/rejected) to a `suggestions` table in Supabase.

### 2. Implement Automated Background Analysis
1.  In `src/main/index.ts`, implement a `setInterval` to trigger the AI workflow automatically every hour.
2.  Introduce a state management variable (e.g., `isAnalyzing`) to prevent the automated trigger from running if a manual or previous analysis is already in progress.
3.  Ensure the automatic analysis only runs if an API key is present in the keychain.
4.  After each successful analysis, archive the processed `prompt_log.json` file to a dedicated archive directory to prevent indefinite file growth.

### 3. Create Dynamic Menu Bar & Iconography
1.  Create the set of monochrome `.png` icons for all states (e.g., `icon-idle.png`, `icon-analyzing.png`, `icon-error.png`) and place them in `src/renderer/assets`.
2.  Create an `AppController` or similar module to manage the application's state.
3.  Implement a function that updates the `Tray` icon by calling `tray.setImage()` based on the current application state.
4.  Update the menu bar context menu dynamically based on state (e.g., disable the "Analyze Now" button when an analysis is in progress).

### 4. Build Robust Onboarding & Permissions Flow
1.  On application startup, use Electron's `systemPreferences.isTrustedAccessibilityClient(false)` to check for permissions.
2.  If permissions are denied, set the application to an error state.
3.  The menu bar should clearly reflect the error, and an item should provide a function to open the specific macOS System Settings pane for Accessibility.
4.  Periodically re-check for permissions so the app can automatically recover from the error state once the user grants them.

### 5. Configure Build & Deployment Pipeline
1.  Install `electron-builder` as a dev dependency.
2.  Fully configure the `build` section in `package.json` for macOS (`mac`), including the `appId`, `copyright`, and paths to signing certificates.
3.  Set up environment variables for the Apple ID, password, and team ID required for notarization.
4.  Add `build` and `release` scripts to the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
